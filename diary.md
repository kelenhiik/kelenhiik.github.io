Created a Github account and made two online repositories from tutorials. One of them from the command-line. Tried out how to create a text file, push it into my repository and then edit it.
nano filename.txt -}_creates the file, extensions can be different_
cat filename.txt -}_Shows the text I wrote in the file on the commandline_
git status -}_Shows what is going on with your file. If you have added something and commited it in, then using this will tell you that there is nothing to commit. However, if you edited the text and use  status it will tell you it is untracked so before committing anything you have to add it to be tracked.
git commit -m -}_Anything you write here in quotation marks will be added as a comment
git add filename.txt -}This is for adding it for tracking.

Created a Github account and made two online repositories from tutorials. Tried out various functions:

`mkdir name` - _Creates empty directory to comp._

`cd name` - _Enter the directory._

`git init` - _Creates empty repository from that._

`nano filename.txt`- _Creates the file using the specified program, extensions can be different_

`cat filename.txt` - _Shows the text I wrote in the file on the commandline_

`git status` - _Shows what is going on with your file. If you have added something and commited it in, then using this 
will tell you that there is nothing to commit. However, if you edited the text and use status it will
tell you it is untracked so before committing anything you have to add it to be tracked._

`git diff` - _Differences in the file compared to the most recently saved one._
                
`git commit -m` - _Anything you write here in quotation marks will be added as a comment_

`git add filename.txt` - _This is for adding it for tracking._

`git add <directory with files>` - _Adds all files in the specified directory for tracking._

`git push origin master` - _Adds my updates to the online version masterbranch? Using "pull" instead of push copies changes from remote to local._

`git clone https:plapla` - _Clones a repository I make online to the computer._

Tried to make a diary for the course work updates and progress by following the steps [here](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/). Github suggested to create a readme file and then only published whatever I had written there so all the text written here was not published. Could not figure out what was wrong or how to change it

Spent the whole morning and evening trying to figure out why the diary does not publish from my master branch, google did not help.

Spent the whole morning still trying to figure out why this page only publishes my README file. Then changed the name of the file I want to be published to "index" I don't know what happened, but it worked. I realized after messing around for an hour I can not format the text in the way I had planned with starting some lines with indendations.
Used ssh to log into the school's computer and edit the index file. Got a problem using nano, it would not let me save the addition. Now trying to use emacs.

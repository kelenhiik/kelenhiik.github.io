Created a Github account and made two online repositories from tutorials. 

`nano filename.txt`- _creates the file, extensions can be different_

`cat filename.txt` - _Shows the text I wrote in the file on the commandline_

`git status` - _Shows what is going on with your file. If you have added something and commited it in, then using this will tell        
                you that there is nothing to commit. However, if you edited the text and use  status it will tell you it is 
                untracked so before committing anything you have to add it to be tracked._
                
`git commit -m` - _Anything you write here in quotation marks will be added as a comment_

`git add filename.txt` -_This is for adding it for tracking._

`git push origin master` - _Adds my updates to the online version?_
